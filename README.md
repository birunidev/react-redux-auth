# React Authentication with Redux

In this project, I implement the authentication flow using redux to manage the states.

For the backend, I use the express js server and passport to make sure that the authentication flow works as expected. and for the front end I use react and tailwind css.

Inside of this app, it is just a static dashbord layout. What this app does is just implementing the login flow. When user is not authorized then they cannot access the dashboard page.

## Unit testing

I also try to do the unit test for some components. it can be found in **tests** folder. and please correct me If I do something wrong.

Thank you
